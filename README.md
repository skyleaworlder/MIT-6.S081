# Syscall

## System call tracing

![tracing](./figure/tracing.png)

* remember to add `$U/_trace\` to Makefile. (xv6 print "exec trace failed" again and again, and I debug very hard and into very deep call layer. function namei() return -1 and don't goto "bad" label to process error)
* add trace_mask as proc's property directly. fork doesn't copy all the properties to new process, it need to assign it to a new one manually

## Sysinfo

![sysinfo](./figure/sysinfo.png)

* I met "succeeded with bad argument", because I use `return 0` directly instead of `return filesysinfo(...)`
* copyout need pagetable, an address, and object to copy. It copies given data to user space.
* user space -> libs defined in user.h --link--> usys.S generated by usys.pl --ecall--> syscall defined in syscall.c --SYS_xxx--> syscall function sys_xxxx

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu). The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.S081, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu. Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".
